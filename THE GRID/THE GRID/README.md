## 🔬 Technical Specifications

### Core Mathematics
```python
# 4D to 2D Projection Formula
fov_rad = math.radians(self.fov)
screen_distance = (self.height / 2) / math.tan(fov_rad / 2)
screen_x = int(self.width / 2 + (rel_x * screen_distance / rel_z) * self.zoom)
screen_y = int(self.height / 2 - (rel_y * screen_distance / rel_z) * self.zoom)

# Consciousness Evolution Formula
phi_resonance = math.sin(time.time() * CONSCIOUSNESS_FREQUENCY / 1000) * 0.5 + 0.5
evolution_rate = self.golden_ratio_harmony * phi_resonance * dt * (1 + grid_field)
```

### Consciousness Constants
- **PHI (φ)** = 1.618033988749895 (Golden Ratio)
- **Base Frequency** = φ × 440 Hz = 711.93 Hz
- **Consciousness Levels** = 5 stages (0-4)
- **Field Strength** = Collective consciousness measurement
