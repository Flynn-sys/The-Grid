# üåê TRON Grid - Clean Implementation

**No bullshit, just a working TRON-style grid visualization**

## What This Actually Does

‚úÖ **Real Features:**
- 3D grid visualization with perspective projection
- Interactive camera controls (WASD + mouse)
- Moving objects with particle trails
- Real-time physics simulation
- Clean, readable Python code
- Works with or without dependencies



## Quick Start

```bash
# Launch the clean interface
python3 clean_launcher.py

# Or run directly
python3 tron_grid.py
```

## Controls

- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**: Rotate camera
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **ESC**: Exit

## Requirements

**For full visual mode:**
```bash
pip install pygame
```

**For terminal mode:**
- Just Python 3.6+ (no dependencies)

## What You Get

1. **Visual Mode** (with pygame):
   - Real-time 3D grid rendering
   - Smooth camera controls
   - Particle effects and trails
   - 60 FPS performance

2. **Terminal Mode** (fallback):
   - ASCII grid visualization
   - Live object position updates
   - Works on any system

## Technical Details

- **3D Projection**: Simple perspective projection with rotation
- **Physics**: Basic collision detection and boundary bouncing
- **Rendering**: Direct pixel manipulation for performance
- **Architecture**: Clean OOP design, easy to extend

## Why This Version?

This is what the other 100+ files were trying to do, but without:
- Fake consciousness emergence equations
- Mystical golden ratio calculations
- Angels with "absolute authority"
- Overcomplicated mathematics that don't actually do anything

Just honest code that creates a cool TRON-style grid visualization.
