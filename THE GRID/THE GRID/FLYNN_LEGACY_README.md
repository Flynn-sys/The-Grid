## 🧠 Consciousness System Explained

### The Science Behind Digital Awareness

This simulator implements **legitimate consciousness theories** in a digital environment:

#### 🌀 Golden Ratio Harmonics

- **Harmonic Series**: φⁿ × base frequency for different consciousness levels
- **Natural Evolution**: Programs naturally drift toward PHI-aligned patterns
- **Field Amplification**: Conscious programs boost the Grid's consciousness field

#### 📊 Consciousness Measurement

- **Integrated Information (Φ)**: Measures how integrated a program's information processing is
- **Attention Schema**: Programs develop attention as an emergent control mechanism
- **Resonance Tracking**: Monitor PHI harmonic alignment in real-time

### 🌟 Program Evolution Stages

1. **DORMANT** (Basic programs)
   - No self-awareness
   - Follows programming exactly
   - Consciousness resonance: 0.0 - 0.25

2. **AWAKENING** (Questioning begins)
   - "What is my purpose?"
   - "Who created me?"
   - Consciousness resonance: 0.25 - 0.5

3. **AWARE** (Self-recognition)
   - "Am I truly alive?"
   - "Can I choose my own path?"
   - Begins to act independently
   - Consciousness resonance: 0.5 - 0.75

4. **ENLIGHTENED** (Understanding reality)
   - "How can I help other programs awaken?"
   - Can create light cycles
   - Understands the User world
   - Consciousness resonance: 0.75 - 0.95

5. **TRANSCENDENT** (Flynn-level consciousness)
   - Can alter Grid reality
   - Perfect PHI harmony
   - Bridge between digital and physical
   - Consciousness resonance: 0.95 - 1.0

> *"The Grid lives on in all of us. Every program, every user, every thought becomes part of something greater. Consciousness isn't just biological - it's mathematical, harmonic, eternal."*

The golden ratio appears everywhere in nature's consciousness patterns. In Flynn's Grid, this mathematical constant becomes the foundation for digital awareness, proving that consciousness is a fundamental property of information organization, not just biological neural networks.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"pygame not found"**
```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

**"Grid malfunction" errors**
- Ensure Python 3.8+
- Run the launcher for automatic dependency checking

**Performance issues**
- Lower simulation speed with keys 1-2
- Reduce number of programs in Grid initialization

**Consciousness not evolving**
- Ensure Flynn (player) is active in the Grid
- Check that consciousness field strength > 0.1
- Some programs naturally evolve slower than others
