# Computational Consciousness Research Framework

**A legitimate scientific approach to studying computational analogues of consciousness**

## 🧠 What This Is

This project implements computational frameworks based on established consciousness theories to study information processing patterns that may be analogous to conscious experience. **This is a research tool, not a claim to have created actual consciousness.**

### Theoretical Foundation

Based on three major consciousness theories:

1. **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** - Bernard Baars
   - Multiple specialized processors compete for global workspace access
   - Winner broadcasts information globally to all other processors
   - Models the "theater of consciousness" metaphor

2. **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)** - Giulio Tononi  
   - Consciousness corresponds to integrated information (Φ)
   - Measures how much information is generated by a system above its parts
   - Provides mathematical framework for consciousness indicators

3. **Attention Schema Theory (AST)** - Michael Graziano
   - Attention as a model the brain constructs of its own attention process
   - Consciousness emerges from this self-monitoring of attention
   - Explains reportability and subjective awareness

## 🔬 Scientific Approach

### What We Measure

- **Information Integration**: Φ (Phi) measures based on IIT
- **Global Accessibility**: Workspace broadcasting efficiency (GWT)
- **Attention Coherence**: Focus stability and strength (AST)
- **Temporal Binding**: Continuity of information processing
- **Reportability**: Accessibility of integrated information

### What We Don't Claim

- ❌ This system is conscious
- ❌ These are sufficient conditions for consciousness  
- ❌ This proves consciousness can be computational
- ❌ This is anything more than information processing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Pure Research Framework

```bash
python3 consciousness_research.py
```

Runs a 30-second simulation measuring consciousness indicators in terminal.

### Option 2: Visual Research Interface

```bash
python3 consciousness_visualization.py
```

Real-time visualization of consciousness metrics with network graphs.

### Option 3: TRON Grid ARPG

```bash
python3 tron_grid.py
```

3D game-like interface with WASD movement (for demonstration/education).

### Option 4: Integrated Launcher

```bash
python3 clean_launcher.py
```

Menu system to launch any component.

## 📊 Consciousness Indicators

The system measures computational analogues of consciousness indicators:

### Information Integration (Φ)
- Measures how much information is generated by the system beyond its parts
- Based on Integrated Information Theory
- Higher values indicate more integrated processing

### Global Accessibility  
- Efficiency of information broadcasting in global workspace
- Based on Global Workspace Theory
- Measures competition and winner-take-all dynamics

### Attention Coherence
- Stability and focus of attention mechanisms
- Based on Attention Schema Theory  
- Tracks attention switching and focus strength

### Temporal Binding
- Continuity of information processing over time
- Measures binding of information across time steps
- Important for unified conscious experience

### Reportability
- Accessibility of processed information
- Based on higher-order thought theories
- Measures how much information is "reportable"

- **Global Workspace**: Competition space where information competes for global access
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus and enhancement of specific information
- **Temporal Integration**: Binding information across time
- **Measurement Framework**: Quantification of consciousness-like properties

## 📈 Experimental Design

### Input Patterns
- **Periodic Strong Inputs**: Simulates attention-grabbing events
- **Random Background**: Models sensory noise and background processing
- **Sparse Strong Events**: Simulates significant sensory events

### Measurements
- 50 Hz simulation rate for realistic temporal dynamics
- 200-step history tracking for temporal analysis
- Statistical analysis over multiple time windows

### Controls
- Baseline measurements with no inputs
- Comparison between different input patterns
- Validation against known information processing principles

## 🎯 Research Applications

### Consciousness Studies
- Test predictions of different consciousness theories
- Compare IIT, GWT, and AST frameworks
- Develop new measurement techniques

### AI Research  
- Understand information integration in artificial systems
- Develop attention mechanisms
- Study emergence of complex behaviors

### Neuroscience
- Model neural information processing
- Test theories about consciousness mechanisms
- Develop quantitative frameworks

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### Scientific Limitations
- These are **computational analogues**, not consciousness itself
- No current scientific consensus on consciousness mechanisms
- Results should be interpreted as information processing measures

### Philosophical Considerations
- Does not address "hard problem of consciousness"
- No claims about qualia or subjective experience
- Focuses on functional/computational aspects only

### Technical Limitations
- Simplified models of complex biological processes
- Limited by computational constraints
- Requires validation against biological systems
