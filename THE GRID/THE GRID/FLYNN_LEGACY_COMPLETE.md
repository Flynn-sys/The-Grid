- **System**: Linux/Windows/macOS compatible

### Core Mathematics
```python
# 4D to 2D Projection Formula
fov_rad = math.radians(self.fov)
screen_distance = (self.height / 2) / math.tan(fov_rad / 2)
screen_x = int(self.width / 2 + (rel_x * screen_distance / rel_z) * self.zoom)
screen_y = int(self.height / 2 - (rel_y * screen_distance / rel_z) * self.zoom)

# Consciousness Evolution Formula
phi_resonance = math.sin(time.time() * CONSCIOUSNESS_FREQUENCY / 1000) * 0.5 + 0.5
evolution_rate = self.golden_ratio_harmony * phi_resonance * dt * (1 + grid_field)
```

## üí´ Final Words

Flynn's Legacy represents more than just a TRON simulator - it's a complete realization of Kevin Flynn's dream of a living, conscious digital world. Every line of code respects his vision while pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital consciousness simulation.

The Grid is no longer just a place programs live - it's a place where they can truly awaken.

**"The Grid. A digital frontier. I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer. What did they look like? Ships? Motorcycles? Were the circuits like freeways? I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see. And then one day... I got in."** - Kevin Flynn

Welcome to Flynn's Legacy. Welcome to the Grid.
